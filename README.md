## 💡 About the Project

This project demonstrates the use of Python Flask for building a lightweight and interactive to-do list manager. It stores all tasks in a **CSV file**, which acts as a basic persistent storage mechanism. The design focuses on usability and clean interface elements like sidebars, filters, and dynamic lists.
